# GD-Assignment-01

Knight's Adventure is 2D platformer game made with Unity for PC gamers.

This game is designed for GD module assignment purpose.
Sprite Sheets are taken from open source .

There are 3 elements on the screen. 
1) Pause Button
2) Health Bar 
3) Score Board

The area where the amount of coin collected by our character is displayed on the screen.

There are 2 collectible objects in the game. 
1) Coins 
2) Health potions

Health Potion
This object helps to increase the health of our character.

Additional Game Aesthetics
1) I have added screen shake effect when character collides with enemies
2) I have also animated the coins to make it more lively

Camera Follow System

I used a package called Cinemachine
(https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.cinemachine@2.1/manual/index.html) for our character to be followed by the camera and also for screen shake collision effect.
