# GD-Assignment-01

Knight's Adventure is 2D platformer game made with Unity for PC gamers.

This game is designed for GD module assignment purpose.
Sprite Sheets are taken from open source .

There are 3 elements on the screen. 
*Pause Button
*Health Bar 
*Score Board

The area where the amount of coin collected by our character is displayed on the screen.

There are 2 collectible objects in the game. 
*Coins 
*Health potions

Health Potion
*This object helps to increase the health of our character.

Additional Game Aesthetics
*I have added screen shake effect when character collides with enemies
*I have also animated the coins to make it more lively

Camera Follow System

I used a package called Cinemachine
(https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.cinemachine@2.1/manual/index.html) for our character to be followed by the camera and also for screen shake collision effect.
